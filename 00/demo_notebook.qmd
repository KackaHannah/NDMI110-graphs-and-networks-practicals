# Demo Notebook
This notebook tests the setup by importing necessary libraries and creating a basic graph.

```{python}
# Import Required Libraries
import numpy as np
import networkx as nx
```

```{python}
# Create a simple graph
G = nx.Graph()
G.add_edges_from([(1, 2), (2, 3), (3, 4), (4, 1)])
print("Nodes:", G.nodes())
print("Edges:", G.edges())
```
